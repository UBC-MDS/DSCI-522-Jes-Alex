## Contributor Code of Conduct

_______________________________________________________

As collaborators, maintainers and NBA enthusiasts, we solemnly swear to respect the contributions of others in this repository whose efforts were made with the best interests of this project kept in mind. 

In striving for the highest quality product we maintain high expectations for individual conduct that will foster positive collaborative relationships, generosity amongst peers, and professionalism in the workplace regardless of setting. 

Individuals whose sole intention is to harm the infrastructure of the project or the spirit of this collaborative effort will be removed as a contributor in the interests of group integrity. Examples of inappropriate behavior include derogatory comments or attacks toward others, trolling, insults, or any other form of harrassment.

Administrators of this repository have full responsibility to add, delete and edit information as well as integrate contributions from others that agree with the work. They also maintain the authority to remove anyone from the project team that does not appeal to the behaviors specified above.

Behaviors of the sort can be reported with an issue or contacting one of the project maintainers.

This marks the end of our code of conduct, happy coding, and we look forward to further contributions!
